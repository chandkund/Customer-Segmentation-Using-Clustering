# Customer Segmentation using Clusteriing 📊

## Overview 🛍️
This project analyzes retail sales data to understand customer behavior through Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) metrics. By clustering customers using K-Means, we aim to identify different customer segments and derive actionable insights to improve marketing strategies and customer engagement.

## Dataset Description 📑
The dataset contains information about retail transactions, including:

- **Description**: The name of the product sold.
- **Quantity**: The number of units sold in each transaction.
- **InvoiceDate**: The date and time when the transaction occurred.
- **UnitPrice**: The price per unit of the product.
- **CustomerID**: A unique identifier for each customer.
- **Country**: The location of the customer.

## Key Objectives 🎯
- Clean and preprocess the data 🧹.
- Perform RFM analysis to categorize customers 🔍.
- Use K-Means clustering to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior 📊.
- Visualize the clusters for better understanding of customer segments 📈.

## Technologies Used 💻
- **Python** 🐍
- **Pandas** 🐼
- **NumPy** ➗
- **Matplotlib** 📊
- **Seaborn** 🎨
- **Scikit-learn** 📚

## How to Run the Project 🚀
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
